						Kudos to Jess for being an absolute linchpin at <abbr title="headquarters">HQ</abbr>. Jess has navigated new session logistics and endless webinars, she has calmly managed a myriad of requests and changing circumstances from the team, bookkeepers, clients and suppliers. Honestly, it would take me all day to work out and list all the things she's been juggling and taking off my hands. And still she finds space to think and plan strategically about things like SEO and the website.

						I appreciate your calmness, your "I’ll fix it" attitude. I appreciate that you have sorted the logistics into such an efficient process. I know I don’t need to chase you for handouts, that you’ll get the job done and let me know if there is a problem. I appreciate all those extra things you do, checking in with us and sharing our successes via client feedback. You do your job in a way that makes it look like everything is effortless which I’m sure it’s not. You are much valued and appreciated.

						Jess encouraged me on a daily basis and ensured I was totally comfortable with the campaign I was on, even offering to participate in practice calls on multiple occasions if I felt I needed it. By the time I left Qualifa I was able to hit targets regularly and felt like a key member of the team, I can only accredit Jess for this! I now feel completely comfortable during phone calls and tele-conferences. My confidence increased substantially while being managed by Jess. I still practice the techniques she taught me!
